# Sentiment-Analysis-Movie-Comments
A comparative sentiment analysis project using rule-based (VADER) and pre-trained transformer models on 1000 movie comments. Includes text preprocessing, model evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix, and improvement suggestions for each approach.


# 🎬 Sentiment Analysis on Movie Comments

This project compares **VADER (rule-based)** and **Transformer (pre-trained)** approaches for sentiment analysis on 1000 movie comments.  
It includes text preprocessing, model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix), and insights for improving each model.

## 📊 Features
- Text cleaning and preprocessing  
- Sentiment classification using **VADER**  
- Transformer-based classification using **Hugging Face**  
- Accuracy and confusion matrix visualization  
- Suggestions for performance improvement  

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python  
- NLTK (VADER)  
- Transformers (Hugging Face)  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

## 📈 Results
| Model | Accuracy | Type |
|--------|-----------|------|
| VADER | ~XX% | Rule-based |
| Transformer | ~XX% | Deep Learning |

## 📂 File
- `hw6_sentiment.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook with complete workflow.

### 🌐 **LinkedIn Post Caption**
🚀 Just completed my **Sentiment Analysis Project**!  
I explored how **VADER** (rule-based) compares with a **Transformer model** on 1000 movie comments.  
📊 From data cleaning to model evaluation — it was a great learning experience applying both NLP techniques and deep learning concepts!

Would you like me to create a **README.md file** for GitHub automatically (with formatted sections, emoji, etc.)? I can generate it based on this project.
